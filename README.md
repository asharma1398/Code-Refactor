### Project Description 
***

For this project I was tasked with improving a company's codebase in order to achieve long term sustainability. To accomplish this, existing code was refactored to follow accessibility standards so that the client's website is optimized for search engines. 

Specifically, semantic html elements and alt attributes for images were added. Both HTML and CSS were reformatted to increase readability.
